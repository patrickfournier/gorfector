        Cropping
    </title>

    <p>
        Once you have done a preview scan, you need to define the area for the final scan. You can inspect the preview
        image and decide which part of the image you want to keep. Press the <gui>Pan</gui> button located below the
        preview image and then pan the image by dragging it with the mouse. Zoom in or out using the
        <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>Mouse Wheel</key></keyseq>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you have inspected the preview image, you may want to crop it to a specific area before scanning.
        To do so,
        you can use the <gui>Scan Area</gui> tool by clicking the <gui>Scan Area</gui> button located below the
        preview image. If you prefer, you can also press the <key>Shift</key> while using the <gui>Pan</gui> tool
        to temporarily enable the <gui>Scan Area</gui> tool. Then, using the mouse, you can draw a rectangle
        on the preview image to define the area you want to scan. You can adjust the rectangle by clicking and
        dragging its corners or edges. You can also move the rectangle by clicking and dragging it while holding
        the <key>Alt</key> key.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also set the scan area by entering the coordinates of the rectangle in the <gui>Scan Area</gui>
        section of the <gui>Basic</gui> parameter tab.
        Some scanners may offer additional cropping options, such as selecting a size from a predefined list of common media sizes.
